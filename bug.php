```php
$file = fopen("path/to/file.txt", "r");
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
    echo "Error opening file.";
}
```
This code has a subtle bug: it doesn't check the return value of `fclose()`. While `fclose()` usually succeeds, it can fail (returning `false`) if there's an error closing the file (e.g., disk full, permissions issues). Ignoring this return value can lead to resource leaks or unexpected behavior.
